# Interview app for Platform Science

### Description
A simple application meant to show a list of drivers associated with a single shipping address
based on specific criteria.

### Videos

### Explanation of documentation
Very little code has documentation as source code is accessible to all using the app.
What is documented is complicated logic that other developers may not understand at a glance
(e.g. the suitability score algorithm)
